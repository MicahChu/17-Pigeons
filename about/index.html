        <h3 style="text-align:center;margin-top:-5px;margin-bottom:20px;">The flock of pigeons:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Malcolm: Malcolm is the drummer of the flock. He has a really good sense of rhythm, although he prefers to put a kick on every and a clap on every other beat out of sheer laziness.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Myrtle: Myrtle is the oldest pigeon in the flock. She knows that kids these days don't appreciate real music, so she adds guitars and pianos to the tracks to make them more "real".</li>
            <br>
            <li>Manning: Manning is used to success. He will work really hard on a track, but only if he feels that it will turn out good.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Monica: Monica is really into meditation. She adds stereo width and ambient effects to the tracks, making them more calming.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Marcello: Marcello really likes heavy stuff. He adds atonal and aggressive basses to the tracks.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Miranda: Miranda too likes heavy and bassy stuff. However, she prefers to work on smooth subbasses.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Mark: Mark is a sample geek. He collects samples from sample packs far and wide. He then discards everything but the best of the drums, and hands them over to Malcolm.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Mildred: Mildred feels like using samples is cheating. She synthesizes drums, and then sends them over to Malcolm.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Martin: Martin really likes house. He is responsible for a majority of the productions of the flock being house. While he prefers big room, the rest of the flock hasn't been ready to go along with that yet.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Michelle: Michelle is always full of ideas. They are crazy and original, and the flock is always scrambling to keep up with them.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Max: Max is the singer of the flock. While he has a naturally nice voice, he is plagued by underconfidence. The rest of the flock believes he can sing though.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Melinda: Melinda is a web developer and designer. She is repsonsible for building all of this website.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Merlin: Merlin is a wizard when it comes to songwriting. His arrangements impress other pigeons far and wide.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Melody: Melody is really good at writing melodies. Some say it comes from her name, others say it comes from hard work and determination. In reality, however, it comes from creativity and music theory.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Mike: Mike is a very attractive pigeon. The rest of the flock lets him hang out with them because of how attractive he is. He has no knowledge of music, and as far as he is concerned all electronic music is dubstep.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Margaret: Margaret is in charge of public relations. She makes sure the SoundCloud, Facebook and website are always kept up to date.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Monroe: Monroe really brings the tracks together. They pull off transitions, mixing, and more to make sure every song is a complete and finished product.</li>
